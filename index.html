        <p class="copy">Tofu, or soybean curd, is a food made by coagulating soy milk and pressing the resulting curds into blocks.
            It is a versatile food, popular in many Asian cuisines and as a plant-based protein source, because it has a
            very mild flavor and can absorb the taste of other ingredients. Tofu is made by soaking and crushing
            soybeans, separating the milk from the pulp, and then adding a coagulant to form curds</p>
